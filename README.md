🛠️ Intel WiFi Card Working on macOS Sequoia!  Without heliport Default macOS WiFi 🛠️
Good news, Hackintosh enthusiasts! If you’re looking to get an Intel WiFi card running smoothly on macOS Sequoia, here’s the method I found:
 1. Start by using itlwm.kext. Boot up and check the PCI list in Hackintool—your WiFi card hardware should appear there.
 2. Right-click the device, copy the device path, then delete itlwm.kext and add AirportItlwm (latest Ventura release) to your EFI.
 3. Go to your EFI Device Properties, paste in the copied path, and add a fake BCM card Device ID (like IONane).
 4. Add these essential kexts to make things work:
 • AMFIPass
 • IO80211FamilyLegacy
 • IOSkywalkFamily
 5. Download OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP), an older nightly version, and run a patch.
Once patched, add a hash tag comment to disable the fake device in Device Properties, restart, and boom—you should be up and running with Intel WiFi on Sequoia, using the default macOS WiFi app! 🌐
